[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Anduin2017/Mercy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Anduin2017/Mercy)

## So simple a web server
Mercy is a simple but powerful web server based on .net standard. It is able to run alone to host a web server at any path, or intergrate with your own application. Using mercy you can start a server so easy!

- [Starting different types of server at the same time](#)
- [Hosting at different ports at the same time](#)
- [Depending on the domain user requests, hosting different apps at the same time](#)
- [Depending on the ip address user requests, hosting different apps at the same time](#)
- [Virtual path](#)

**Mercy DO NOT rely on Microsoft asp.net. So mercy is small, simple and fast. It can be used as a dependent module.**

## So easy a HTTP middleware
Mercy is able to run as a HTTP middleware. Just like nginx or IIS, Mercy is able to act as a inverse proxy server or a load balance server.

Everything you do in nginx and IIS, you can do in Mercy.

- [Static HTTP server](#)
- [FTP server](#)
- [Inverse proxy server](#)
- [Load balance server](#)
- [MVC web application](#)

## So fast a framework
Mercy is a web development framework based on .net standard.

Web app based on asp.net core works fast. App starts costs about 5 seconds.

Web app based on Golong works faster. App starts costs about 2 seconds.

But now Mercy is different. Mercy is sooo fast that it starts only costs **0.5 seconds**.

- [MVVM web app](#)
- [Dependency injection](#)
- [Globalization and localization](#)
- [Sign in control and user control](#)

**Mercy do not rely on asp.net or asp.net core! All features of Mercy works differently with asp.net features!**

## So small a module
You can install Mercy as a module of your application using Nuget.

`PM> Install-Package Anduin.Mercy`

or [Download as dll](#)

Using Mercy as a module you can customize your server using your own code and in your own application.
