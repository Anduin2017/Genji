## What is Mercy
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Anduin2017/Mercy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Anduin2017/Mercy)

### So fast a framework
Mercy is a web development framework based on dot net core.

After .Net core is released, ASP.Net web apps run so much faster than .Net framework age. An ASP.Net core app starts costs about only 7 seconds while an ASP.Net app starts costs about 20 seconds. While ASP.Net core is fast, it is not fast enough.

Web app based on Golong works faster. App starts costs about 2 seconds.

But now Mercy is different. Mercy is sooo fast that it starts only costs **0.5 seconds**.

### Cross platform
Mercy is based on dot net core. Mercy do not depend on any third-party library that we have done all the works by ourselves. Also we have tested it on different operating systems. Mercy do not require a inverse-proxy server, like nginx or IIS.

Just configure your target port, target domain and web root path, Mercy will run so easily.

### Mercy grammar
Mercy is a server development framework that it is also able to operate source HTML. Using tag like `Mercy-if`, `Mercy-foreach` is so easy for you to learn and develope.

### Manage data with EF
To manage your database Mercy uses EF core. EF core is also a cross-platform framework and also supports SQL Server, MySQL databases.
